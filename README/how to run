Installing NPM modules on both client and server folders
Open terminal and write these commands : 

for client (frontend) :   cd client
               npm install

for server(backend) :  cd server 
                       npm install

In the server > .env file, you can find some information.
So find your mongodb cloud url with database which will look like this: mongodb+srv://myusername:myclusterpassword@mycluster.mongodb.net/ecommerce?
